FlightGear Flight Simulator 0.9.6

you need to install in this order:

plib-1.8.3
openal-0.0.7 (formerly from cvs)
simgear-0.3.7
flightgear-0.9.6 & post-install
fgfs-base-0.9.6

plz, read carefully every ports Pkgfile

note1:
this sw "eats" a big amount of disk space and so
i've decided to install it in /opt

note2:
in the flightgear port there is a post-install line
that, obviuosly, cannot be removed automatically 
when you'll do a 'pkgrm flightgear'
